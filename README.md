# 🎯 FokusTimer: Comprehensive Pomodoro Timer Application

## 📋 Project Overview  
**FokusTimer** is a feature-rich Pomodoro timer app designed to boost productivity through structured work intervals. Based on the popular **Pomodoro Technique**, it helps users stay focused by breaking work into 25-minute sessions followed by short breaks—reducing mental fatigue and improving concentration.

## 🧠 What is the Pomodoro Technique?  
Developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is a simple yet effective time management method:

- ✅ Work with intense focus for 25 minutes (one "Pomodoro")  
- ✅ Take a short 5-minute break  
- ✅ After completing 4 Pomodoros, take a longer 15–30 minute break  
- 🔁 Repeat the cycle
